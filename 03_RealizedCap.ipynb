    "# HODL Waves\n",
    "Author: [@typerbole](https://twitter.com/typerbole), [GitHub](https://github.com/ty-perbole), [stack-stats.com](http://www.stack-stats.com)\n",
    "\n",
    "For the second installment of the Stack Stats series we're going to generate our own HODL Waves charts as popularized by [Dhruv Bansal at Unchained Capital](https://unchained-capital.com/blog/hodl-waves-1/). In the previous notebook we used CoinMetric's community data, which is mostly pre-calculated for us. This time around we're going to get our hands dirty and work directly with raw on-chain data, building some familiarity with blockchain data structures that will serve us well for future tasks such as calculating Realized Cap.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the second notebook in the [Stack Stats](http://www.stack-stats.com) repository. See the [Stack Stats readme](https://github.com/ty-perbole/stack-stats/blob/master/README.md) for more about this project and further instructions in how to run the jupyter notebook. This tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with Python and SQL."
